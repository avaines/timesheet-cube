# timesheet-cube
A janky Timeular alternative using an Aqara cube and an Office365 calendar

I am not paying £70 for a bit of plastic and £10 a month to use it. But I would find some of the features. namely, a way of tracking which project I'm currently working on and for it to be historically referable.

I already have an Office 365 subscription with calendars and I don't mind spending £20 on AliExpress,
